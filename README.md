# Concurrent-genetic-algorithm

Made for the class: **CSC 375 - Parallel Programing**


In this project we focused on concurrent java loving structures. This code is a genetic algorithm that solves an optimization problem. The Constraints class is responsible for all of the customization of the board. Some of these customizations include ones to the genetic algorithm population, crossover, and fitness metrics. The code is complete with a swing interface that shows the progress of the solution.
